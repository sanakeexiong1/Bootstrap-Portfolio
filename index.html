        <p class="intro">
            Hello and welcome! My name is Sanakee, I am a mother, learner, and lover of food. Here you can find my
            portfolio full of random images. Most of these images were found from Unsplash, a free source photo library.
            It's a great tool to use in comparison to Google Photos (also a great tool but can be annoying to find the
            image source).
            <br>
            <br>
            In my free time I love to spend time with my family. I have a two year old son, Easton and a one year old
            daughter, Alina. Both are such a joy to watch interact and grow together. I run a family and lifestyle blog
            called House of Honey Bees to keep as a diary as my children grow. I also recently just started vlogging.
            <br>
            <br>
            As for my career I am currenly working as a QA Specialist for bulb Digital Portfolios. My day to day work
            consists of testing new features that will be released to the public on the platform.
